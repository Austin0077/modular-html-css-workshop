All too often writing HTML and CSS is an afterthought. Its the work that happens after design is finalized and the product has been developed. Its a necessary task in the process to building a website. Wrong.

HTML and CSS are the backbone to every website, and are equally as important as any design or development. At the end of the workshop and after spending time writing some of code attendees will be able to better organize their code, develop modular styles, and work with CSS specificity.

# Turbo (Advanced)

Pure HTML and CSS allow us to be modular however CSS preprocessors greatly boost our capabilities, providing even more resources for better flexibility, organization, and performance. Using [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) let&#8217;s take another look at our example, refactoring it to be even more modular.
